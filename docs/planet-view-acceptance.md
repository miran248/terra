# Planet view acceptance

This records the production acceptance boundary for [#45](https://github.com/miran248/terra/issues/45)
and [#57](https://github.com/miran248/terra/issues/57). Behavioral tests alone do
not establish rendered correctness or live performance.

## Reproduce

From the checkout root on the target M4 Pro, choose a new output directory whose
parent exists:

```sh
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/terra-spec-45/target-57 \
TERRA_PLANET_ASSET_ROOT=/Users/miran/projects/miran248/terra/crates/main \
  scripts/capture_planet.sh /tmp/terra-spec-45/acceptance-57-final
```

The asset-root override is only needed when using a worktree without its own
generated assets. A normal checkout defaults to its `crates/main` directory.
The runner uses the pinned toolchain and builds the `asset-review` feature in the
repository's development profile. It honors `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, retains build and
application logs, and never replaces an existing evidence directory. It validates
all required files and independently recalculates the raw timing statistics in
`independent-performance-summary.csv`. Recheck saved evidence without launching:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_planet_capture.py /tmp/terra-spec-45/acceptance-57-final
```

The opt-in driver uses `TERRA_PLANET_ACCEPTANCE_CAPTURE`. It runs the production
camera and live simulation; the frozen lighting and other showcase capture modes
must not be combined with it. The runner clears those other capture flags. Keep
the normal primary window on the normal display without resizing it during a
run. The recorded physical/logical viewport, scale factor, and present mode are
the authority for the measured configuration.

## Evidence contract

- Source revision, dirty patch/status, SHA-256 source and generated-asset hashes,
  hardware/display information, toolchain, build command and runtime settings.
- Twelve primary-window captures: ground, settlement, globe, and opposite
  hemisphere, each at noon, sunset, and night. The manifest records the actual
  camera, body, sun, and rendering settings.
- Four live routes: entry/reversal, orbit/zoom, follow/vehicle/recovery, and
  return/reversal. Each has a warmup and three measured 60-second repeats with
  moving bodies, physics, streaming, and world animation active.
- Unfiltered real-time frame intervals in a raw CSV per repeat, plus median,
  p95, p99, maximum, and counts over 33.33 ms. Screenshots are outside measured
  windows. Cross-feature events and the final acceptance status remain alongside
  the raw evidence.

Prefer p95 at or below 16.67 ms. Investigate intervals over 33.33 ms and reject
recurring stalls below the 30 FPS minimum. For this acceptance run, a route is
rejected when at least two of its three repeats contain an interval above
1000/30 ms; no slow frames are filtered out. If tuning is needed, reduce distant
visual detail and shadow cost before navigation readability or simulation
correctness. Validate fog/atmosphere continuity, depth and clipping, ambient
stability during detached orbit, night navigation, labels, progressive detail,
camera clearance, fades, and displaced-material prepass parity.

## Recorded outcome

Pending the actual rendered and performance run. No screenshots or frame-time
results are claimed by this placeholder. Replace this section with the measured
configuration, evidence directory, results, inspection findings, and any remaining
failures before closing #57.
